screen blend mode

screen is algebraically identical to 1-((1-a)*(1-b))


quick algebra shows:
1-(1-a)(1-b)
1-(1-a-b+ab)
1-1+a+b-ab
a+b-ab
a+b(1-a) //a*ONE+b*ONE_MINUS_SRC_COLOR



1-(1-a)(1-b)

is commutative. Swap a and b and the result is the same.


EDIT: if you meant associative, which is

(a screen b) screen c === a screen (b screen c)

then we want to show

(a+b(1-a)) + c*(1-(a+b(1-a)) === a+(b+c*(1-b))(1-a)

expanding both sides

a+b-ab+ c*(1-(a+b-ab)) === a+(b+c-bc)(1-a)

a+b-ab+c*(1-a-b+ab) === a+b-ab+c-ca-bc+abc

a+b-ab+c-ca-bc+abc == a+b-ab+c-ca-bc+abc

which shows its associative too


HENCE it doesnt matter WHAT order you draw lights in, or even if you group lights together and draw layers at a time


Do NOT bash the screen blending mode. It's one of the MOST important ones you should know. It brightens without ever oversaturating
